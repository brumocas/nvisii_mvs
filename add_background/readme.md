Here’s a simplified version of the `README.md` file for a subfolder of your project:

```markdown
# Image Background Adder Script

This script adds a background image to multiple images located in a folder and its subfolders. The output images are saved in a specified directory, preserving the original folder structure.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (Python Imaging Library)

### Install the Pillow library:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

## How to Use

1. **Background Image**: Place your background image in the folder where the script is located.
   
2. **Input Folder**: Place all images that need backgrounds in the `input_images/` folder (including subfolders if needed).

3. **Output Folder**: The processed images will be saved in the `output_images/` folder with the same subfolder structure as the input.

4. **Run the Script**:

```bash
python add_background_to_images.py
```

This will apply the background to all images in the `input_images/` folder.

## Folder Structure Example

```
your_project/
    ├── add_background_to_images.py
    ├── background.jpg
    ├── input_images/
    │   ├── folder1/
    │   │   └── image1.jpg
    │   └── folder2/
    │       └── image2.png
    └── output_images/  # Generated here after running the script
```

## Customization

- **Change Position**: You can change the position of where the foreground is pasted onto the background by modifying the `position` variable in the script.

```python
position = (50, 50)  # Adjust as needed
```
